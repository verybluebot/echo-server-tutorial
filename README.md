## Description 
The [Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pww3NJuWnk&list=PLFmONUGpIk0YwlJMZOo21a9Q1juVrk4YY) will go through most of [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) features like requests types, CRUD, playing with headers, cookies
Middlewares and more.
Starting from the very basic 'hello world' and finishing with a full production server ready for a real

master is the last published part.

 run the server: 
 
 ```
